  <p>The following page describes what to do when you run into a
  problem that is preventing you from getting work done. Please take a
  moment and read through this page before sending an email asking for
  help.</p>

  <ol>
    <li>Read the User&#39;s Guide in the GraphMaker installation directory,
    which explains most of the primary application functionality.</li>

    <li>Read the help pages on the pertinent topics, as there is often
    something to learn.</li>

    <li>Review the FAQ on the web site (code.google.com/p/graphmaker) to
    see if this problem has come up before.</li>
  </ol>

  <p>There are two avenues for asking questions about GraphMaker. The first
  is to email the author (nathanfiedler@gmail.com) and the second is to
  send the question to the graphmaker-user mailing list. When asking for
  help, be sure to mention the <strong>GraphMaker version</strong>
  that you are using.</p>
