  <h2>Reporting Bugs</h2>

  <p><small><a href="#seealso">See Also</a></small></p>

  <p>Before reporting a new bug, it would be very helpful to ensure
  that the bug has not already been found (and possibly fixed).</p>

  <ol>
    <li>Ensure that you are using the latest version of GraphMaker. If not,
    you must try to reproduce the problem using the latest version. The
    bug may have been found and fixed already.</li>

    <li>Read the pertinent documentation and help information to be
    sure you understand the proper operation of the application.</li>

    <li>Search the bug database on the web site. This is a lot easier
    than it may seem at first.</li>
  </ol>

  <p>If it still seems like you have found a new bug, please send the
  <strong>operating system</strong>, <strong>JDK version</strong>, and
  <strong>GraphMaker version</strong> that you are using, along with the
  <strong>problem description</strong>, to the
  <strong>graphmaker-bugs</strong> mailing list.</p>
