  <h3>Manual Testing</h3>

  <p>Prior versions of GraphMaker had instructions for manually testing
  the GraphMaker interface. This, while useful, is a tremendous amount
  of work to develop and maintain, not to mention dreadful to perform.
  Therefore, explicit testing of the interface will not be documented.
  Instead, it is left to the developer to perform his or her own tests,
  as deemed necessary. That is, while developing GraphMaker, you are
  obligated to perform basic testing to ensure that the features you
  develop actually work.</p>
