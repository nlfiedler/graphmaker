  <h1>README</h1>

  <h2>GraphMaker</h2>

  <p>GraphMaker is a Java application to create graphs consisting of
  nodes connected by directed and undirected edges, and perform various
  graph operations on them, such as breadth-first-search and
  minimum-spanning-tree.</p>

  <h2>Requirements</h2>

  <p>As of version 3.0, GraphMaker requires the Java Runtime
  Environment version 1.4 or better. It utilizes the preferences and
  XML parsing classes made available in the core library.</p>

  <h2>Starting GraphMaker</h2>

  <p>Starting the application amounts to invoking a small launcher.
  There are two possibilities at the moment, depending on your
  system.</p>

  <h4>Microsoft Windows</h4>

  <p>If you are using Microsoft Windows, you can double-click on the
  <strong><code>graphmaker.exe</code></strong> launcher in the
  <code>bin</code> directory, or invoke it from the command line.</p>

  <h4>Unix-like systems</h4>

  <p>On Unix-like systems such as Linux or Solaris, simply invoke the
  shell script <strong><code>graphmaker</code></strong> in the
  <code>bin</code> directory.</p>

  <h3>Startup options</h3>

  <p>The GraphMaker launcher is basically a renamed version of the
  NetBeans Platform launcher, thus it supports the same command-line
  options. For a list of these options and a brief explanation, invoke
  the launcher with the <code>--help</code> switch.</p>

  <h2>Documentation</h2>

  <p>The GraphMaker documentation consists of a <a href=
  "UsersGuide.html">User&#39;s Guide</a>, the built-in help found in
  the <strong>Help</strong> menu in the main program window.</p>

  <h2>Removing GraphMaker</h2>

  <p>Removing GraphMaker from your system is generally pretty simple.
  Find the files, wherever it is that you originally put them, and
  delete them. If you used one of the packaged versions you should
  remove the package using the appropriate system command. In addition
  to the program files, there are user settings stored in a directory
  named <code>.graphmaker</code> in your home directory.</p>

  <h2>Upgrading the JDK</h2>

  <p>If at some point you replace your current JDK installation with a
  different version, you will need to update the GraphMaker
  configuration file. This is done by opening the
  <code>etc/graphmaker.conf</code> file in a text editor and changing
  the <code>netbeans_jdkhome</code> value to point to the new JDK
  installation directory. An alternative to editing the configuration
  file is to pass the <code>--jdkhome</code> option when starting
  GraphMaker. This option takes a single argument, which is the path to
  the JDK installation.</p>

  <h2>Getting help</h2>

  <p>For help on using GraphMaker, write an email to the <a href=
  "mailto:nathanfiedler@gmail.com">author</a>.</p>
