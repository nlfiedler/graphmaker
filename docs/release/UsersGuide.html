  <h1>GraphMaker User&#39;s Guide</h1>

  <h2>Window management</h2>

  <p>The display areas within the main GraphMaker window are themselves
  called windows. These windows display various pieces of information.
  Initially not all of the windows are visible, so you may want to
  peruse the <strong>Window</strong> menu to look for the other
  available windows. To arrange the windows within the main window,
  click on the title bar of the window and drag it to a different
  location. You will see a colorful outline that indicates where the
  window will be displayed when you release the mouse button. You can
  change the size of the windows in relation to one another by dragging
  the dividers between the window areas (an area is a collection of
  windows which occupy the same space, referred to as &quot;modes&quot;
  in NetBeans terminology).</p>

  <h2>Flashing red icon</h2>

  <p>When you see a flashing red icon in the lower right corner of the
  main window, that indicates that an unexpected error occurred. Click
  the icon to see an explanation, along with a stack trace. If such an
  error prevents the application from operating normally, please send
  the error message and stack trace to <a href=
  "mailto:nathanfiedler@gmail.com">nathanfiedler@gmail.com</a> so the
  problem can be entered into the bug tracking system.</p>
