  <h1>GraphMaker: Credits</h1>

  <p>GraphMaker is principally developed and maintained by Nathan
  Fiedler, with contributions from various individuals. As of version
  4.0, GraphMaker owes a great deal to the <a href=

  Platform provides the application framework on which GraphMaker is
  deployed.</p>

  in the original university project based on the PC/GEOS platform.</p>
