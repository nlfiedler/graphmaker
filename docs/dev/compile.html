  <h2>How to Compile, Run, and Debug GraphMaker</h2>

  <p>The following is an abbreviated set of steps for building
  GraphMaker from source code. If you encounter complications at any
  point, please refer to the detailed steps given in the following
  sections.</p>

  <ol>
    <li><a href="http://java.sun.com/javase/">JDK 6.0</a> must be
    installed to compile GraphMaker.</li>

    <li><a href="http://www.netbeans.org/">NetBeans IDE 5.5</a> must be
    installed, as GraphMaker is based on the NetBeans Platform.</li>

    <li>Make the build: <kbd>ant build</kbd></li>

    <li>Run the application: <kbd>ant run</kbd></li>
  </ol>

  <p>If that worked for you, then you are on your way to developing
  GraphMaker. However, if there was a problem, continue reading the
  following sections for detailed information.</p>

  <h3>Installing Required Software</h3>

  <h4>Java Development Kit</h4>

  <p>GraphMaker is written in the Java language, version 6.0. Visit the
  <a href="http://java.sun.com/javase/">Java SE</a> page and download
  the release appropriate for your system. After installing the JDK,
  make sure to add the <code>bin</code> directory to your
  <code>PATH</code>.</p>

  <h4>Apache Ant</h4>

  <p>Building GraphMaker requires the use of Apache <a href=
  "http://ant.apache.org/">Ant</a>, a build tool written in Java. In
  general you should use the latest stable release, but you may find
  that a slightly older release will work as well. Chances are you will
  have to set the <code>JAVA_HOME</code> environment variable to point
  to the JDK installation, and possibly also <code>ANT_HOME</code>,
  which points to the Ant installation directory.</p>

  <p><em>Alternatively, you can just rely on the Ant version that is
  bundled with the NetBeans IDE, rather than installing a separate
  version.</em></p>

  <h4>NetBeans IDE</h4>

  <p>GraphMaker is based on the NetBeans Platform, thus to build
  GraphMaker you will need to install the <a href=
  "http://www.netbeans.org/products/ide/">NetBeans IDE</a>. Developing
  GraphMaker within the NetBeans IDE is highly recommended, as it makes
  many of the mundane tasks much easier.</p>

  <p>You may also want to download the NetBeans Platform source code
  and API documentation, which can be found at the URL given above.</p>

  <h3>Building GraphMaker</h3>

  <p>Once the JDK and NetBeans are installed, you are ready to build
  GraphMaker. Invoke the <em>build</em> target on the
  <code>build.xml</code> in the root of the source tree. This will
  compile all of the modules and produce the GraphMaker modules.</p>
  <pre>
ant build
</pre>

  <h3>Running GraphMaker</h3>

  <p>Invoke the <em>run</em> target of the top-level
  <code>build.xml</code> file. You should soon see the GraphMaker
  splash screen followed by the main window.</p>
  <pre>
ant run
</pre>

  <h3>Debugging GraphMaker</h3>

  <p>Invoke the <em>debug</em> target of the top-level
  <code>build.xml</code> file. The application will start in debug mode
  and the IDE debugger will be connected to it automatically. <em>Note
  that this target only works inside the NetBeans IDE.</em></p>
  <pre>
ant debug
</pre>
