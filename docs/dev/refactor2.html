  <h2>3.0 Design Changes</h2>

  <h3>Multiple versus Single Document</h3>

  <p>The most significant change in version 3.0 is the loss of the
  multiple document interface. Instead, the main window now always
  contains exactly one document. Instead of multiple document windows,
  GraphMaker now supports multiple main windows, each with its own menu
  bar and tool bar.</p>

  <p>The reasons for this are simple. First, it was of little value to
  the user. Secondly, it was more of a nuisance, design-wise, to
  implement. Additionally, by always having a document to edit, the
  actions and commands no longer have to check if a document exists.
  Finally, the interface is simpler and easier because of this
  change.</p>

  <h3>Document-centric</h3>

  <p>The design of version 3.0 is now centered around the
  <code>Document</code> interface. Each main window is associated with
  a single <code>Document</code> instance, mapped via the utility
  class, <code>DocumentFrameMapper</code>, defined in the
  <code>ui</code> package. Previously actions would query the current
  graph tool for the list of selected elements, whereas now the actions
  query the document. By eliminating the document group class, this
  makes the other classes more reliant on the document instance for
  information about the document.</p>

  <h3>One Format to Rule Them All</h3>

  <p>The 2.x versions of GraphMaker had the novel ability to read and
  write one of two document formats: GAM and GML. &quot;GAM&quot; stood
  for Graph Adjacency Matrix, I think, while &quot;GML&quot; stood for
  Graph Modeling Language (developed by Michael Himsolt). The GAM
  format was really just a subset of the GML format, and offered only
  the most basic properties of graph elements. The GML format was quite
  good in that it was easily extensible and humanly readable. However,
  the implementation for reading and writing GML was more complicated
  than it had to be.</p>

  <p>Enter the eXtensible Markup Language, or XML format. This, like
  GML, is easily extensible and humanly readable. The other primary
  benefit is that it is easy to parse. JDK 1.4 provides both SAX and
  DOM XML parsers in the core classes. Thus supporting XML is easy and
  the code is significantly simpler than the old GML code.</p>

  <p>Thus in version 3.0, only the XML format is supported. See the
  <code>graph.dtd</code> file in the <code>document</code> package for
  the exact format.</p>
