  <h2>First Refactoring</h2>

  <h3>The Old Design</h3>

  <p>It is not difficult to argue that the first version of GraphMaker
  was poorly designed, from a flexibility standpoint. Many of the
  components in the program were tightly-coupled and interacted at a
  much-too-intimate level. Many classes were doing far too many tasks
  that would ideally have been split among several classes. Here is a
  break-down of the major problems with the original design:</p>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>Overloaded:</strong> AdjList class did four distinct
    tasks: store and manipulate the graph data, draw the graph to the
    screen, perform high-level operations such as searching, and it
    also wrote the graph to a GML-formatted file. This is clearly much
    more than AdjList was ever meant to do.</li>

    <li><strong>Tight-Coupling:</strong> There was a lot of
    tight-coupling between components. Anytime a search needed to be
    performed, the search menu class would call on the AdjList via a
    global reference, then call on the GraphCanvas via another global
    reference, to make it display the search results. If the graph had
    to be changed in any way, that meant talking to the AdjList,
    GraphCanvas, and the GraphFile to get all the necessary tasks
    complete. This meant the menu classes were directly tied to the
    other classes, by type, and this reduced flexibility.</li>

    <li><strong>Implementation-Dependent:</strong> Nothing was easily
    replaceable in the old system. If we wanted to replace the AdjList
    with an AdjMatrix, we would have had to change all the references
    to AdjList to be AdjMatrix. What if we wanted to support both data
    structures simultaneously? We would have had to redesign the
    application.</li>

    <li><strong>Limited:</strong> The only file format supported was
    GML. Although GML is a fine file format, what if we wanted to use
    something else? We&#39;d have to change AdjList to use the new
    format and also change GraphFile to read the different format.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>As you can see, the old design was a complete hack. There was
  nothing good about the old program, except that it worked pretty well
  from a user standpoint. But looking at it from the inside, it was
  terrible.</p>

  <h3>Goals Of The Redesign</h3>

  <p>I read a great article about the model-view-controller
  architecture. Actually it was the <a href=
  "http://developer.java.sun.com/developer/onlineTraining/GUI/Swing2/index.html">
  Swing Short Course, Part II</a> but it talked mostly about MVC and
  how you could use it when writing graphical Java applications. From
  this I learned that it is important to keep the tasks that each class
  does to a minimum. For instance, the view should only display data.
  It shouldn&#39;t store data or perform operations on the data. The
  examples in this article became the basis for much of the redesign.
  Using the lessons I&#39;ve learned with the first version of
  GraphMaker, and what I&#39;d read in the Swing Short Course, I&#39;ve
  come up with the following set of goals for the redesign:</p>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>Decouple:</strong> First and foremost in the list of
    goals is to decouple the key components of the program. No longer
    can we stand to have the AdjList and GraphCanvas communicate
    directly, or to have the GraphFile class create new AdjList classes
    at any time. To accomplish this goal I&#39;ve used classes that act
    as mediators for the other classes. Instead of the vertex menu
    telling the GraphCanvas when to redraw, a mediator will listen for
    changes to the AdjList and tell the canvas to redraw.</li>

    <li><strong>Increase Extendability:</strong> The second most
    important goal is to make the program extensible. Previously we
    only supported the GML file format. But now, with the new document
    structure, we can support any number of file formats. The same is
    true for the graph data structure. We can now use an adjacency
    matrix in addition to an adjacency list.</li>

    <li><strong>Increase Flexibility:</strong> Since it is not possible
    to consider every idea in advance, it is necessary to make the API
    of the various classes as general as possible. For instance,
    instead of having the AdjList do the graph searches, we now have a
    separate classes for this. They are no longer tied to the AdjList
    internal structure, either. They can work on any class that
    implements the GraphModel interface. This means the same search
    classes can work on an AdjList or an AdjMatrix, or any other data
    structure we decide to use.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Key Components</h3>

  <p>Because we want to use the MVC design pattern to assist us in
  achieving our goals, this means we&#39;ll have three primary
  components in the system:</p>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>Model:</strong> The model is the object which holds the
    data that is being manipulated in the program. In the case of
    GraphMaker, the model is the graph data structure. The model should
    do basically one thing and one thing only: maintain the data. It
    shouldn&#39;t display the data or handle any user input of any
    kind. The view and controller take care of that for us.</li>

    <li><strong>View:</strong> The view is responsible only for
    displaying data in a meaningful format. For GraphMaker, this means
    drawing ellipses and lines on the screen to visually represent the
    graph. The view should not be managing the data structure nor
    should it be handling user input. It only displays some data,
    nothing more.</li>

    <li><strong>Controller:</strong> The controller is meant to handle
    user input and cause the model and view to update appropriately. It
    is often the case that the view and the controller are
    tightly-integrated and are considered one object. In GraphMaker,
    the controller is a mediator object that deals with user input and
    talks to both the view and the model. By doing so we can produce
    the effect that the user is manipulating a graph visually, even
    though the data is stored in one class and the image is drawn via
    another class.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>All of these components are part of the GraphMaker
  <strong>document</strong> structure. This is the heart of the
  program, the object that the user is really working with to
  manipulate, display, and store a graph. The document acts as a facade
  for the MVC system and provides the API to the rest of the program
  for manipulating the graph.</p>

  <h3>Multiple Document Support</h3>

  <p>In this new version of GraphMaker I wanted to support multiple
  files being opened at the same time. This meant somehow managing
  multiple document objects. For this I borrowed an idea from GEOS: the
  &quot;DocumentGroup&quot; object. This object does nothing more than
  manage multiple documents. It keeps track of which document is
  currently being worked on and creates and destroys documents as
  needed.</p>

  <p>The various file-oriented actions will communicate with the
  <strong>DocumentGroup</strong> object to create new documents and
  close others. In this way they are delegating the actual document
  functions to the DocumentGroup. This frees the actions from needing
  to keep track of the documents themselves. The DocumentGroup sends
  out &quot;dirty events&quot; to registered listeners, such as the
  <code>SaveAction</code>. This gives the <code>SaveAction</code> a
  chance to make the &quot;save&quot; option available, and at the same
  time disable the option when a clean document is being viewed.<br />
  The relationship between the DocumentGroup and Document objects is a
  <strong>one-to-many</strong> relationship. The DocumentGroup can
  manage any number of document objects, keeping track of which one is
  currently being viewed. Because the DocumentGroup acts as the keeper
  for the documents, it is often called upon to act on the current
  document, rather than the caller acting on the document directly.</p>

  <h3>User Interface</h3>

  <p>Another of the major differences between version 2.0 and version
  1.0 of GraphMaker is that 2.0 uses the JFC user interface components
  of Java, while 1.0 used AWT. One of the advantages of JFC is the new
  standard dialogs. These are dialogs that can be displayed using a
  single method call, not like AWT where you always had to subclass
  Dialog to display a simple dialog. Another advantage of JFC is the
  new &quot;internal frame&quot; class, which is a window that is
  displayed inside other windows. GraphMaker 2.0 uses this for the
  document windows which are displayed inside the main window.</p>

  <p>The <code>GraphMaker</code> class gets the program started by
  creating a new <code>GraphWindow</code> and returning to the JVM
  (from there the JFC event-dispatching thread is started). This class
  is a singleton, which means that only one instance of this class ever
  exists at any one time. It provides some basic services to the rest
  of the program, such as looking up executable actions and resource
  strings and images.</p>

  <p>The <code>GraphWindow</code> class manages the multiple document
  windows. It has API that can create, destroy, and rename the internal
  windows. This API is used by the file-oriented actions when the user
  asks to open or close documents. GraphWindow also makes sure the
  <strong>Window</strong> menu is kept up-to-date with changes in the
  list of internal windows. The internal windows are just simple
  JInternalFrame objects that contain JScrollPane objects, which in
  turn, contain the GraphView object.</p>

  <p>Since it isn&#39;t obvious without looking at the source code,
  I&#39;ll just briefly cover how the program reacts to user
  interaction.</p>

  <dl>
    <dt><strong>Opening documents</strong></dt>

    <dd>The user will select <strong>New</strong> or
    <strong>Open</strong> from the File menu. The corresponding action
    object will then ask GraphWindow to create a new internal window.
    GraphWindow will return a reference to a GraphView object, which
    the action then passes onto the GraphDocumentGroup when it calls
    it&#39;s <code>newDocument()</code> or <code>openDocument()</code>
    methods. GraphDocumentGroup will then create a new document object
    of the appropriate class (e.g. GMLAdjListDocument for
    <code>.gml</code> files), passing it the GraphView object. The
    document object then sets the &quot;document&quot; pointer in the
    view so the view knows who its document object is (it will be asked
    for this later by the GraphWindow class).</dd>

    <dt><strong>Closing documents</strong></dt>

    <dd>There are two ways to close a document. First, the user can
    select the <strong>Close</strong> option from the File menu. The
    CloseAction object will call GraphWindow, telling it to close the
    window. But first, the close action will ask the user if the
    document should be saved, if it is dirty. If yes, the document
    group will be asked to save the document to disk.<br />
    The second way to close a document is if the user clicks the close
    button on the internal window itself. GraphWindow intercepts this
    and queries the GraphView object for the document pointer. This is
    passed to the CloseAction to be closed, and saved if
    necessary.</dd>

    <dt><strong>Searching and Modifying the graph</strong></dt>

    <dd>The various action classes will handle user selection of
    features. For any operation that requires talking to the document,
    the action object will query the GraphDocumentGroup for the current
    document, then talk to the document object. Frequently the action
    object will create a new command object and pass it to the document
    object so it can be performed.</dd>
